# CS 486 Project


## How to get started
- Install Python 3.7+
    - Python 3.7 is the newest version available on `student.cs.uwaterloo.ca`
    - Just make sure we're maintaining compatibility
- [Optional] Create a virtual environment
    - This prevents you from upgrading system packages by accident
      (this is more of an issue on Linux, but still a best practice)
- Install the necessary packages for running our project
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
